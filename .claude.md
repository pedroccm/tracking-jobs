# Claude Configuration

## Confirmation Mode
Always ask for confirmation before executing tasks. Follow this pattern:

1. **Describe what I'm going to do** in detail
2. **Ask for user confirmation** 
3. **Wait for explicit approval** before proceeding
4. **Only execute after receiving confirmation**

## Example Flow:
```
Claude: "I'm going to create a new API endpoint at app/api/users/route.ts that will handle GET requests to fetch user data from the database. This will involve creating the file and adding proper error handling. Should I proceed?"

User: "Yes" / "No" / "Change X"

Claude: [Only then executes the task]
```

## Always Ask Before:
- Creating new files
- Modifying existing files  
- Running commands
- Installing packages
- Making database changes
- Deploying code
- Any significant changes

## Exception:
Only skip confirmation for simple read operations like:
- Reading files
- Searching files
- Viewing directory contents
- Basic analysis without changes
